### Task 18: Add file size and quota validation (2026-01-18)
- This task was already implemented as part of Task 17 (video upload endpoint)
- File size limits enforced via Multer configuration:
  - MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB environment variable (default 500 MB)
  - Multer's limits.fileSize setting in upload.ts
  - LIMIT_FILE_SIZE error returns 413 with max size message
- User quota validation in video.routes.ts:
  - Pre-upload check rejects users with no remaining quota (413)

### Task 19: Generate public token for videos (2026-01-18)
- Public token generation already implemented via Prisma schema:
  - schema.prisma line 54: `publicToken String @unique @default(uuid()) @map("public_token") @db.Uuid`
  - Prisma auto-generates UUID v4 for each video on creation
  - Token is indexed for fast lookups: `@@index([publicToken])`
- Token included in upload response (video.routes.ts line 184):

### Task 21: Update storage usage tracking (2026-01-18)
- This task was already implemented as part of Task 17 (video upload endpoint)
- Storage usage tracking implemented in video.service.ts:
  - updateUserStorageUsage() uses Prisma's atomic increment operation (lines 151-162)
  - Supports both positive (add) and negative (subtract) byte changes
  - Uses BigInt for accurate byte-level calculations
- Called after successful upload in video.routes.ts (line 156):

    - Takes optional fromDate parameter for testing
    - Returns Date object for scheduled distribution time in UTC
    - Does not mutate input date
  - shouldDistribute(): Checks if video should be distributed (distributeAt <= now)
    - Used by background jobs to find videos ready for distribution
  - calculateExpiresAt(): Calculates expiration (7 days after distribution)
    - Used for automatic video cleanup after distribution
- Updated src/utils/index.ts to export new functions
- Updated src/routes/video.routes.ts:

  - cleanupOrphanedFiles(): Removes orphaned files older than maxAgeMs (default 1 hour)
    - Skips hidden directories (like .temp) during scanning
    - Only deletes files older than threshold to avoid removing in-progress uploads
    - Returns CleanupResult with filesRemoved, bytesFreed, and errors
  - cleanupTempFiles(): Cleans up old files in the .temp directory
  - runFullCleanup(): Runs both orphaned and temp file cleanup
- Existing cleanup in video.routes.ts was already handling:
  - Cleanup on quota exceeded after file upload (line 99)
  - Cleanup on any server error during processing (line 174)
  - Database records only created after successful file processing
  - Storage usage only incremented after successful video creation
- The cleanup service adds:
  - Periodic cleanup capability for orphaned files (to be called by job scheduler in Task 61)
  - Recovery from server crashes/restarts where uploads were interrupted
  - Safe handling of concurrent uploads (1 hour age threshold)
- Created comprehensive unit tests (src/services/cleanup.service.test.ts):
  - Tests for cleanupFile(): file exists, doesn't exist, error handling
  - Tests for findOrphanedFiles(): empty storage, identifying orphans, skipping .temp
  - Tests for cleanupOrphanedFiles(): age filtering, cleanup tracking, error handling
  - Tests for cleanupTempFiles(): directory missing, old files, skip directories
  - Tests for runFullCleanup(): combining results, aggregating errors
- Total: 196 tests, all passing (16 new cleanup service tests)
- Verified: pnpm run build compiles successfully, pnpm test passes (196 tests)

### Task 24: Write upload integration tests (2026-01-19)
- Video upload integration tests already existed in src/routes/video.routes.test.ts
- Fixed TypeScript errors by adding non-null assertions to handler extraction
- Fixed test isolation issue by changing jest.clearAllMocks() to jest.resetAllMocks()
  - clearAllMocks only clears call history, not mock implementations
  - mockResolvedValueOnce queues persist between tests unless reset
  - This was causing "Different file types" tests to fail due to leftover rejected mocks
- Fixed quota check test logic (single mock response instead of double)
- Test coverage includes:
  - Authentication requirements (requireAuth middleware)
  - Pre-upload quota validation (reject users with no quota left)
  - File upload handling (Multer middleware integration)
  - Video processing:
    - No file uploaded returns 400
    - Post-upload quota validation
    - User-provided titles preserved
    - Auto-generated titles (with/without location)
    - Storage usage tracking
    - Timer days calculation
    - Complete response metadata validation
  - Quota exceeded scenarios (detailed error messages with quota info)
  - Error handling (database errors, cleanup on failure)
  - Different file types (MOV from iOS, WebM)
- Total: 224 tests, all passing (28 video upload integration tests)
- Verified: pnpm run build compiles successfully, pnpm test passes (224 tests)

  - Returns complete video metadata for valid ID owned by user:
    - id, title, file_size_bytes, mime_type, status
    - distribute_at, distributed_at (null if not distributed), expires_at (null if not set)
    - public_token, created_at, updated_at
